//3. Comparison Operators
//TRUE or FALSE
/*
== - Equality Operator - Compares two values for equality, after converting both values to a common type (Type Coercion)
=== - Strict Equality Operator - Compares two values for equality, without performing type conversion (No Type Coercion)
!= - Inequality Operator - Compares two values for inequality, after converting both values to a common type (Type Coercion)    
=== - Strict Inequality Operator - Compares two values for inequality, without performing type conversion (No Type Coercion)
!= - Inequality Operator - Compares two values for inequality, after converting both values to a common type (Type Coercion)
!== - Strict Inequality Operator - Compares two values for inequality, without performing type conversion (No Type Coercion)
> - Greater Than Operator - Compares if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right
< - Less Than Operator - Compares if the value on the left is less than the value on the right
>= - Greater Than or Equal To Operator - Compares if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right
<= - Less Than or Equal To Operator - Compares if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right

//Logical Operator
//AND (&&) - Returns true if both operands are true
//OR (||) - Returns true if at least one of the operands is true
//NOT (!) - Returns true if the operand is false, and false if the operand is true
